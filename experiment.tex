\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{bib:LHC_machine_2008,bib:LHC_2004} is a particle accelerator installed in the former LEP~\cite{bib:LEP_design_1984} tunnel at CERN~\cite{bib:CERN:web}.
It is 26.7~\km in circumference and consists out of two separate rings, which are, in periods of operation, inhabited by two counter-circulating beams.
At the interaction points of the two beams, either proton-proton collisions or heavy ion collisions take place.
In this thesis, only collision data from the year 2012 is analysed.
Thus all machine values cited in the following chapters and paragraphs refer to the setup in 2012.

The beams are separated into bunches which rotate with a bunch spacing of 50\ns corresponding to a collision frequency of 20\mhz.
Before the bunches are actually filled into the LHC rings they are pre-accelerated in other accelerators, which are (in the order they are actually passed by the protons) Linac2, Proton  Synchrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Synchrotron (PS), Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).
The injector chain and the LHC ring with its experiments is visualised in Fig~\ref{fig:LHC}.

\end{figure}

In the LHC, the beams are kept on the circuit with the help of a magnetic field of 4.76\tesla.
Further quadrupole and sextupole magnets squeeze and focus the bunches.
They have a spread of roughly 8\cm length and a Gaussian shape radius of 20\mum RMS at the interaction point.



\begin{itemize}
\item luminosit - integrated luminosity
\item the number of produced events for a cerntail process is given by the cross section times integrated luminosity
\item  luminosity is machine dependent and for the LHC
\item All experiments
\item lumi plot
\item pileup plot
\end{itemize}
