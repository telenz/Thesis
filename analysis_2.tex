\section{Simulated samples}
\label{sec:SimulatedSamples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Event weights applied for correct Pileup modelling
\item Detailed information can be found in Experimental setup chapter
\item Think what to write in the detector chapter to be not wiederholend     
\end{itemize}

Detector chapter:
\begin{itemize}
\item THINK!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SM samples}
\label{sec:SMSamples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Title: Background samples
\item To study the background, following samples were used: ... generated with ...
\item Not all SM processes samples were availbale
\item Not so dramatic, because data based bkg estimation method
\item Main Background are ... ???
\item Only a few were available and thus processed
\item Most important sample was included: Wjets
\item ZoNuNu Backgorund not availbale plays also a role (see DT paper!)
\item Table of SM samples with cross-sections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Signal samples}
\label{sec:SignalSamples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lifetime reweighting
\item Simulation of lifetime in Geant
\item Trigger emulation
\item What samples are exactly generated.
\item Madgraph+Pythia
\item Chargino Pair production + Chargino neutralino production
\item Table with generated signal samples with cross-sections???? No
\end{itemize}

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:EventSelection}
\subsection{Datasets and triggers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Datasets and triggers used in the analysis
\item signal samples generated with Madgraph and pythia
\item They are decayed in Geant to only pions. Around ten different lifetimes were simulated
\item For other lifetimes: lifetime reweighting is done PLOT
\item For five diffenrent masses (100-500 GeV) 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Preselection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivate different selection cuts
\item Reference DT search for most of them
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Main discriminating variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item dE/dx
\item pt
\item Show some MC signal bkg comparioson plots (only Wjets?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Sources of backgrounds}
\label{sec:SourcesOfBackgrounds}
\begin{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of fake tracks
\item How can they fake the signal
