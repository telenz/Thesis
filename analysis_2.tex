\section{Simulated samples}
\label{sec:SimulatedSamples}

For the investigation of the various backgrounds to this search, the analysis relies also on simulated sample.
An extensive introduction to the techniques and tools required for the simulation of SM and beyond SM processes can be found in Section~\ref{FIXME}.

In the following two sections an overview about the used SM (Section~\ref{sec:SMSamples}) and SUSY samples (Section~\ref{sec:SignalSamples}) is given.
All samples are reweighted to match the measured distribution of primary vertices in data.

\subsection{SM Background samples}
\label{sec:SMSamples}
To investigate the sources of background, various simulated SM samples were used.
In order to have the possibility to make use of the $dE/dx$ variables, a special data format of the simulated samples is required (called RECO format).
Unfortunately, not all SM processes were available in this format in which also the information about the energy release in the tracking system is included.
However, as this analysis needs to rely anyways on a data-based background estimation method, because of the limited quality of the $dE/dx$ simulation.
this does not constitute a serious problem, but only limit the possibility of an extensive comparison between data and simulation going beyond shape comparisons.

In Table \ref{tab:SMsamples_RECO} all SM samples are listed which were available in the RECO format and are used in the analysis.

\end{table}  
Due to the immense size of the samples (between 5 and 70\,TB) and in order to match a reasonable storage space a reduction was done by selecting only events which contain at least one leading jet with a minimum transverse momentum of $\pt>60\gev$.

In addition, further simulated samples not containing the energy information are used.
These are needed to study the backgound inclusively in the variable \ias.
They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:SMsamples_AOD}.

\subsection{Signal samples}
\label{sec:SignalSamples}
For the investigation of a possible signal, events containing either chargino pair production $q\bar{q} \rightarrow \chipm \chimp$ or chargino neutralino production $q\bar{q} \rightarrow \chipm \chiO$ are simulated. 
The simulation is done with the matrix-element event generator \madgraph \cite{bib:Madgraph_2014}
The parton showering and hadronization processes are then simulated with Pythia 6 \cite{bib:Pyhtia6_2006}.
A last step is needed to simulate the interations of the generated particles with the detector material, which is done with \geant \cite{bib:Geant4_2003,bib:Geant4_2006}.

Furthermore, a speacial treatment for long-lived particles is required.
In order to get the right detector simulation of the energy loss of the long-lived particles which decay after the beam pipe, the lifetime of the chargino cannot be set in the matrix-element generator but needs to be specified within \geant.
This also means, that the decay products are only existing in the detector simulation, but are not accessible as particles in the event generators.


To narrow down the required computing sources, the simulation was only done for a few lifetimes (1\cm, 5\cm, 10\cm, 50\cm, 100\cm, 1\,000\cm and 10\,000\cm).
To get still a tight scan over the lifetime space, other lifetimes were generated using lifetime reweighting.
This can be done by determining for every event a weight which is depending on the individual proper lifetime of the chargino (in case of chargino pair production it depends on the individual lifetime of the two charginos).
The event weight is given by
\begin{equation*}
w = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\tau^{\text{gen}}}{\tau^{\text{target}}}\cdot  \exp \left[ t_i \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\tau^{\text{target}}} - \frac{1}{\tau^{\text{gen}}} \right) \right] ,
\end{equation*}
where $n$ is the  number of charginos in the event, $\tau^{\text{gen}}$ is the generated mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame and $t_i$ is the individual proper lifetime of the chargino. 
The resulting mean lifetime is then given by $\tau^{\text{target}}$. A derivation of this formula can be found in Appendix~\ref{blabla}.
With the reweighting procedure a tight covering of the lifetime space could be achieved with lifetimes of \ctau = $a\cdot10^{n}$ for $n$=0,1,2,3,4 and $a$=$\left[1,9\right]$.
Figure~\ref{fig:LifetimeReweighting} shows the exponential distribution of the individual proper lifetime of the charginos after reweighting a simulated sample with $c\tau^{\text{gen}}=50\cm$ to a lifetime of $c\tau^{\text{target}}=10\cm$.
Fitting the exponential spectrum should result in the correct mean proper lifetime as parameter of the fit.
It can be seen, that the reweighting procedure can reproduce the targeted lifetime of 10\cm.
\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering 
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/analysis/10cm.pdf}

  \caption{Normalized distribution of the proper lifetime $d_{\text{lab}}/\left(\beta\gamma \right)$ of all charginos contained in a signal sample with a generated lifetime of $c\tau^{\text{gen}}=50\cm$ reweighted to a lifetime of $c\tau^{\text{target}}=10\cm$.}
  \label{fig:LifetimeReweighting}
\end{figure}


All samples were generated for different chargino masses always almost mass-degenerate to the lightest neutralino.
The mass gap between chargino and neutralino was set to 5\gev.
However, as this analysis does not make use of the other decay products and the lifetime is set in \geant, the mass gap does not play any role.
Six different masses from 100\gev to 600\gev are simulated.
This leads then to a total number of 42 signal samples.
In Table~\ref{tab:SignalCrossSections} the NLO-NLL\footnote{NLO: next-to-leading order, NLL: next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy} cross sections at $\sqrt{s}=8\tev$ for $\chipm\chimp$ and $\chipm\chiO$ production 
with wino-like charginos and degeneracy between $m_{\chipm}$ and $m_{\chiO}$ are listed \cite{bib:SignalCrossSection_2012,bib:SignalCrossSection_2013}.
The cross section does not dependent on the lifetime of the chargino.

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:EventSelection}
\subsection{Datasets and triggers}
\label{subsec:DatasetsAndTriggers}

The analysis is performed on pp collision data recorded in the year 2012 at the CMS experiment for a center-of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=8\tev$.
In total an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv was recorded in 2012.

As outlined in Section~\ref{sec:GeneralSearchStrategy}, already on trigger level, the detection of chargino tracks is a challinging task.
The direct detection of events containing chargino tracks on trigger level is not possible because there were no information at CMS about the tracking system on L1 level available.
Furthermore, there is no intrinsic missing transverse energy in the event, when the chargino (or both charginos) decay inside the trigger.
Therefore, the detection of these events shall be achieved with the help of the radiation of the initial state quarks.
When initial state radiation occurs, it is possible to trigger on a high-\pt jet and also on \met in the event.

For this purpose, several triggers are exploited.
It is required that at least of them must have fired to consider the event in the analysis.
In Table~\ref{tab:triggers}, the triggers are listed together with the recorded corresponding integrated luminosity  in the time when they were active.
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{table}[!hbt]
\centering
\caption{\met and \met+jet triggers used in the analysis together with the recorded corresponding integrated luminosity in the time when they were in place.}
\label{tab:triggers}

 HLT\_MET120\_HBHENoiseCleaned                    &  19.7  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}  

The HLTMonoCentralPFJet80\_PFMETnoMu95\_NHEF0p95 and HLTMonoCentralPFJet80\_PFMETnoMu105\_NHEF0p95 triggers exploit both the L1 ETM40 trigger, which requires the missing energy to be larger than 40\gev.
On HLT level, they require further a least on PF jet with \pt$>80\gev$ and the PF missing transverse momentum \met (not taken into account the \pt of any muon in the event) to be larger than 95\gev (or 105\gev).
Finally, the energy release by neutral hadrons must not be larger than 95\% for all jets in the event.
The HLTMonoCentralPFJet80\_PFMETnoMu95\_NHEF0p95 trigger was in place during Run\,A and Run\,B in 2012 data taking, whereas HLTMonoCentralPFJet80\_PFMETnoMu105\_NHEF0p95 was set during Run\,C and Run\,D in 2012.

The HLT\_MET120\_HBHENoiseCleaned trigger is based on the two L1 triggers ETM40 and ETM36 which are combined by a logical OR.
On HLT level, the trigger requires that the missing energy measured in the calorimeter is larger than 120\gev.
The HBHENoise filter reduces background from electronic noise in the HCAL.

Table~\ref{tab:SearchSamples} lists the datasets in which the triggers used in the analysis are comprised. 
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{table}[!hbt]

\end{table}  
Again, because of the size of the datasets (150.5\,TB in total), a reduction of the size is achieved by selecting only events with at least one jet with a minimum \pt of 50\gev.\\

In addition, the analysis makes use of the datasets listed in Table~\ref{tab:ControlSamples}.
These datasets are used for background estimation purposes and the estimation of their associated systematic uncertainties.

\subsection{Candidate track selection}

In order to supress events originating from SM processes (such as QCD-multijet events, $W$+jets, etc. ), a selection for signal-like tracks is applied which shall be described in the following sections.
The candidate track selection follows closely the selection required in \cite{bib:CMS:DT_8TeV}.\\

First, to supress cosmic events and noise from the beam halo a selection on the quality of the vertex can be applied.
This selection includes requirements of the position of the vertex with respect to the beam axes and the number of degrees of freedom (which is strongly correlated to the number of tracks originating from the vertex) \cite{bib:CMS:Tracking_7TeV_PAS}:  
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item The vertex must have at least four degrees of freedom: \mbox{$vtx$ with $\geq 4$ d.o.f.}
\item The position of the vertex along the beam line must be within 24\cm from the beam origin: \mbox{$|dz| \leq 24\cm$.}
\item The position in the transverse direction must be within 2\cm from the beam origin: \mbox{$|d0| \leq 2\cm$.}
\end{itemize}
After these selection cuts are applied the remaining events are subjected to a further preselection.\\


To maximise the signal acceptance, the trigger related selection cuts are chosen as close as possible to the trigger thresholds (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:DatasetsAndTriggers}).
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalMET+SignalJetPt}, the distributions of \met and the transverse momentum of the leading jet \ptfirstjet are shown for different signal models.
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering 
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/analysis/hMet_log.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/analysis/h1stjetpt_log.pdf}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Distribution of missing transverse momentum (left) and the transverse momentum of the leading jet (right) for four different signal samples}
  \label{fig:SignalMET+SignalJetPt}
\end{figure}
Only jets are taken into account with $|\eta|<2.4$ and which fullfill several further criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Charged hadron energy fraction $>0.2$
\item Charged electromagnetic energy fraction $<0.5$
\item Neutral hadron energy fraction $<0.7$
\item Neutral electromagnetic energy fraction $<0.7$.
\end{itemize}
These requirements ensure that noise from cosmics and beam halo is supressed \cite{bib:CMS:DM_8TeV_AN}.
In can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:SignalMET+SignalJetPt} that already for a selection of $\met>100\gev$ 80\% of the signal events are rejected.

The trigger efficiency as a function of PF MET and \ptfirstjet was determined within~\cite{bib:CMS:DM_8TeV} with a single-muon reference sample.
The trigger paths become fully efficient for $\ptfirstjet \gtrsim 110\gev$ and $\met \gtrsim 220\gev$~\cite{bib:CMS:DM_8TeV_AN}.

However, as said before, this search imposes a trigger selection to maximise the signal acceptance:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item In every event needs to be at least one jet within $|\eta|<2.4$ with transverse momentum larger than 110\gev which fullfilles the above mentioned noise cleaning criteria: \mbox{$\pt^{\text{1. jet}}>110\gev$}
\item The missing transverse momentum must be larger than 100\gev: \mbox{$\met>100\gev$}
\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.9cm}

Because of the huge cross-section, Multijet events are frequently produced at the LHC.
Due to jet energy mismeasurements, they can also contribute to data samples recorded with MET triggers.
Therefore, some special requirements to suppress events emerging from strong production processes are enforced.
QCD-multijet events can be characterized by topologies were two jets are almost back-to back.
Additionnaly, in QCD-multijets events the missing energy is usually aligned with one of the leading jets in the event.
Therefore the following two requirements are suffiecient to supress QCD-multijet events efficienctly.
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item $\Delta\phi$ between any of two subleading jets (with $\pt<20\gev$ and $|\eta|<4.5$) in the event must be smaller than 2.5: \mbox{$\Delta\phi\left( j_i, j_j\right)<2.7$}.
\item $\Delta\phi$ between any of the two leading jets (with $\pt<20\gev$ and $|\eta|<4.5$) and the \met must be larger than 0.5: \mbox{$\Delta\phi\left( j_{1,2}, \met \right) > 0.5$.} 
\end{itemize}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDcuts}, the maximal $\Delta \phi$ of any of two subleading jets  and the minimal $\Delta \phi$ between the \met vector and the first two subleading jets for the QCD-multijet data set and two different signal datasets is shown.\\
\begin{figure}[!t]

  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/analysis/hDeltaPhiMaxbeforeCut_lin.pdf}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Maximal $\Delta \phi$ between any of two subleading jets (left) and the minimal $\Delta \phi$  between the \met vector and the first two jets (right) normalized to unit area after the trigger selection.}
  \label{fig:QCDcuts}
\end{figure}
\hspace{0.9cm}

After the reduction of background processes with event based variables, a track based selection is carried out.
To get an optimized selection for possible chargino tracks several signal track characteristics are exploited.

First a selection of tracks of good quality is enforced:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item Only tracks are considered within the tracker acceptance: $|\eta|<2.1$.
\item The track must be of ``high purity'' as defined in~\cite{bib:CMS:Tracking_2010}.
\item No missing middle or inner hits of the track is required: $N_{\text{lost}}^{\text{middle/inner}}=0$
\item The radial distance of the track to the primary vertex must be within 0.02\cm.
\item The longitudial distance of the track to the primary vertex must be within  0.5\cm.
\end{itemize}
In Figs~\ref{fig:Eta_HighPurity},~\ref{fig:LostHits} and~\ref{fig:d0_dz}, the power of the various track selection cuts are shown.\\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Absolute value of the radial (left) and longitudinal (right) distance between the track and the primary vertex after trigger requirements and QCD supression cuts.}
  \label{fig:d0_dz}
\end{figure}

Finally, to reject background tracks emerging from SM processes, an electron, muon and tau veto is applied.
That means all candidate tracks are rejected in case theyr are in a cone of $\Delta R<0.15$ around a reconstructed electron, muon or tau.
Additionally, the candidate track must not be within a cone of $\Delta R<0.5$ around a subleading jet ($\pt<20\gev$ and $|\eta|<4.5$).
Unfortunately, the veto cuts lack efficiency in some of the detector directions.
For example, the reconstruction of an electron easily fails in the direction of a dead ECAL cell.
This reduces the discrimination power of the eletron veto.
For this reason, tracks which point to a dead ECAL cells are rejected.
A general list of dead and noisy ecal cells is provided centrally at CMS.
Further dead cells were identified within a study in \cite{bib:CMS:DT_8TeV} resulting in a total number of 1234 dead/noisy ECAL channels. 
These are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:DeadECALmap}.
\begin{figure}[!t]

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Visiualizaion of dead or noisy ecal cells in the $\phi - \eta$ plane.}
  \label{fig:DeadECALmap}
\end{figure}
Additionally, also tracks which point torwards intermodule gaps of ECAL cells or to the ECAL barrel endcap gap at $1.42<\eta<1.65$ are rejected.
A list of all ECAL intermodule gaps is given in Table~\ref{tab:IntermoduleGaps}.
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

\end{table}  

The muon reconstruction is less efficient for muons in detector regions with bad CSC cells.
Thus, also tracks pointing in these regions are rejected.


\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item The track must have a minimal transverse momentum of 10\gev: \mbox{$\pttrk>10\gev$.}
\item No further substantial activity must be around the candidate track: \mbox{blabla.}
\end{itemize}

Further discrimination power shows the isolation of the track which is defined as the sum of all track's transverse momentum in a cone of $\Delta R < 0.3$ around the candidate track.
See Figure~\ref{blabla} for a comparison of signal against background.\\

Finally, a first loose selection on the transverse momentum is enforced:
Summary:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\footnotesize{\ding{118}}}
\item The track must have a minimal transverse momentum of 10\gev: \mbox{$\pttrk>10\gev$.}
\item No further substantial activity must be around the candidate track: \mbox{blabla.}
\end{itemize}

A summary of all preselection criteria is given in Appendix~\ref{app:blabla}.

Given the presented preselection requirements, a set of four variables remain, which shall be used in the main selection of this analysis, where an optimization is conducted.
These are the transverse momentum of the track, the energy release per path length of the track, the energy deposit in the calorimeters and the number of missing outer hits.
Explicetly no selection of the number of missing outer hits is applied.
