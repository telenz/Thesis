\chapter{Optimisation of the search sensitivity}
\label{sec:Optimisation}
Finally, having all background estimation methods in place, an optimisation procedure is conducted in order to increase the search sensitivity with respect to different signal models as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:SignalSamples}.
The optimisation is done in the most sensitive variables, \pt and \ias (see Section~\ref{sec:Ias} for a definition and explanation of the Asymmetric Smirnov discriminator \ias).
A potential additional discriminating variable is the number of missing outer hits \nlostouter in the tracker system. 
This variable is, however, not considered in this analysis because studies show that the discriminating potential is limited (see Appendix~\ref{app:OptimisationNLostOuter}).
%For low lifetimes, a tiny increase in sensitivity of the order of 1-3\% is possible by a $N_{\text{lost}}^{\text{outer}}>0$ selection.
%However, as this variable means also a new source of uncertainty on the signal model, such a selection cut is not considered.

SUSY models with different chargino lifetimes and masses are characterised by different \pt and \ias distributions as well as different theoretical cross sections.
Therefore, the usual search optimisation startegy that maximises $N_S/\Delta B$ ($N_S$ = number of events of model $S$, $\Delta B$ = background uncertainty) implies a potential fine-tuning on the specific SUSY cross sections.
In order to keep the search as general as possible, a cross section independent optimisation is performed.
This is achieved by a minimisation of the cross section for which a 5$\sigma$-discovery of the corresponding signal model is possible, \ie finding the optimal selection cuts for \pt and \ias for which the lowest possible cross section, $\sigma_{\text{min}}$, can be discovered
\begin{align}
\label{eq:optimisation}
%\frac{\sigma_{\text{min}}\cdot \mathcal{L}}{\Delta B} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{min}}\cdot \mathcal{L}}{\sqrt{ \left(\Delta B_{\text{stat}}\right)^2 + \left(\Delta B_{\text{sys}}\right)^2}} \geq 5.
\frac{\alpha_{\text{min}} \cdot N_S(\text{mass},\ctau,\pt^{\text{cut}}, \ias^{\text{cut}})}{\Delta B (\pt^{\text{cut}}, \ias^{\text{cut}})} = 5. && \text{with   } \alpha_{\text{min}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{min}}}{\sigma_{S}}.
\end{align}
The number of expected events $N_S$ of the signal model $S$ depends on the \pt and \ias selection cut as well as the mass and the lifetime of the chargino.
The uncertainty on the background $\Delta B$ is dependent on the \pt and \ias cut, and takes into account the full systematic uncertainty as well as the statistical uncertainty on the background prediction which is the 68\% one sided upper limit of a Poisson distribution with $\mu = N_B$ estimated with the Neyman construction~\cite{bib:Neyman_1937,bib:PDG_2014}.
The systematic uncertainty on the background prediction includes systematic uncertainties as described in Section~\ref{sec:SysUncertaintiesBkg}, and statistical uncertainties arising from limited statistical precision of the control regions and simulated samples used in the background estimation.
The facor that is minimised $\alpha_{\text{min}}$ is the ratio of the minimum cross section $\sigma_{\text{min}}$ divided by the nominal cross section $\sigma_{S}$ of the signal model S.\\

As this analysis focuses on short tracks, only low lifetimes are considered in the optimisation procedure: $\ctau=1\cm-10\cm$.
To cover the full mass space, the optimisation is done for masses between 100\gev and 500\gev.
The corresponding results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:optimisation}.

It can be seen that the optimal selection is highly dependent on the signal models.
The best sensitivity for low masses ($\leq 200\gev$) is mainly achieved by soft selection cuts in \pt between $20-30\gev$, while models with higher chargino masses require tighter \pt selections of around 50\gev.
The optimal \ias selection is mostly dependent on the mass of the chargino.
For low masses and low lifetimes a soft selection in $\ias>0.05$ is preferred. 
Since for longer lifetimes more charginos are able to reach the tracking system, a tighter selection in \ias of 0.3 is preferable.
For high masses the highest search sensitivity is always achieved by a high \ias selection cut of 0.3.\\

In order to visualise the mass and \ctau dependence of the optimal \pt and \ias selection, the optimisation results for two very different lifetimes (5\cm and 50\cm) and masses (100\gev and 500\gev) are visualised in Fig.~\ref{fig:optimisation}, where the minimum cross section that is possible to discover is shown in the $\pt-\ias$ plane.
For the visualisation, general systematic uncertainties on the leptonic and the fake background of 100\% and 20\% respectively are imposed.
Uncertainties arising from limited statistical precision of the samples used for the background estimation are propagated consistently into formula~\ref{eq:optimisation}.

\end{figure}
Also here, it can be seen that for low masses and low lifetimes, the highest search sensitivity is achieved by imposing rather soft selection cuts on \ias and \pt.
Optimising for higher lifetime pushes the optimal selection in \pt and \ias to larger values, where signal models with higher masses prefer even tighter \ias selection cuts than the corresponding lower mass signal model.
It can also be seen, that for low lifetimes, the \pt dependence of the search sensitivity is less pronounced than for long lifetimes.\\


Based on the optimisation, four different exclusive signal regions are defined in order to achieve an optimal coverage over a wide mass space and a high sensitivity for different lifetimes:
\begin{enumerate}[1.)]
\item $30\gev<\pt<50\gev$ and $0.05<\ias<0.3$
\item $\pt>50\gev$ and $0.05<\ias<0.3$
\item $30\gev<\pt<50\gev$ and $\ias>0.3$
\item $\pt>50\gev$ and $\ias>0.3$.
\end{enumerate}

After developing the methods of the background estimation for all different background sources and their corresponding systematic uncertainties (all explained in Section~\ref{sec:BackgroundEstimation}), 
the search is performed in four exclusive signal regions with 19.7\fbinv of data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8\tev$ at the CMS experiment.
The predicted number of events for the fake and the leptonic background in the four signal regions is depicted in Table~\ref{tab:BackgroundPrediction}.

It can be seen, that fake tracks are by far the dominant background to this search.
The leptonic background contributes only in one signal region to the total background with a share of about 10\%.

Finally, the comparison between the predicted number of events and the number of observed events is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FinalResult}.

The event yields observed in data after each selection requirement for the four signal regions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:CutflowData} in Appendix~\ref{app:cutflow}.

The results are compatible with the Standard Model background within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties in all four signal regions.
No excess above the SM prediction is observed in either of the four signal regions.
Thus, no evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model could be found.

Therefore, in the following section these results will be used to constrain the parameter space of supersymmetric models with almost mass degenerate charginos and neutralinos.

\chapter{Interpretation}
\label{sec:Interpretation}
In order to interpret the result of the search in the context of supersymmetric models with almost mass degenerate charginos and neutralinos, sources of systematic uncertainties on the number of selected signal events must be identified and quantified.
The interpretation will then be done with statistical methods that allow for the exclusion of parts of the supersymmetric parameter space on a 95\% confidence level.

\section{Systematic uncertainties of simulated signal samples}
The systematic uncertainties on the number of signal events in the four signal regions are mainly caused by uncertainties on the quality of the simulation.
This influences the signal efficiency of each selection requirement in this analysis.
Furthermore, an uncertainty on the overall number of events is caused by the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity recorded in 2012 at CMS and the theoretical signal cross-sections.

All systematic uncertainties are estimated for each signal model and each search bin seperately.
In the following, the minimum and maximum value of the corresponding systematic uncertainty will be given.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the theoretical cross section}
The theoretical cross sections of $\chipm\chimp$ and $\chipm\chiO$ production at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\tev are taken from~\cite{bib:SignalCrossSection_2012,bib:SignalCrossSection_2013}.
The corresponding theoretical uncertainties are ranging between $4.5-12.1\%$.

\subsection*{Luminosity uncertainty}
The integrated luminosity recorded at CMS during the year 2012 is measured with the counting of pixel clusters during the crossing of two bunches (zero-bias event).
A detailed explanation of this method and the corresponding total uncertainty of 2.6\% can be found in \cite{bib:CMS:Lumi_PAS}.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of initial state radiation}
Initial state radiation affects the transverse momentum distribution of the 2-particle system, $\pt\left(p_1^{\mu} + p_2^{\mu} \right)$, in a 2-body decay.
Differences between data and simulation of ISR are taken into account by reweighting the transverse momentum of the $\chipm\chimp$ or $\chipm\chiO$ system.
The weights are determined with a comparison of the simulated and observed \pt distribution of $Z$ and $\bar{t}t$ events, done in~\cite{bib:CMS:ISR_AN}.
To account for the systematic uncertainties on the reweighting procedure, the event weights are varied up and down dependent on the $\pt^{\chi_1\chi_2}$ up to variations of 25\%.
The resulting uncertainty on the ISR simulation is between $9.2-12.6\%$.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of the trigger efficiency}
The HLTMonoCentralPFJet80\_PFMETnoMu105\_NHEF0p95 trigger with the higher MET threshold of 105\gev active in Run\,C and Run\,D during 2012 was not available in the simulated signal samples.
It is therefore emulated using L1 trigger information. 
More details on the emulation of this trigger can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:TriggerEmulation}.

The trigger uncertainty is accessed by comparing data-simulation differences of the trigger efficiency.
This has been done within~\cite{bib:CMS:DT_Thesis,bib:CMS:DT_8TeV_AN}.
The resulting differences are applied as variations of the event weights of the simulated samples.
The corresponding uncertainty lies between $1.9-4.4\%$ for the signal samples.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the jet energy scale}
The transverse momentum of all jets is corrected for non-uniformities in the energy response as a function of the jet $\eta$ and \pt~\cite{bib:CMS:JME_PAS} and for data-simulation differences.
The uncertainty on the jet energy scale (JES) arise from the systematic uncertainty of the jet response in data like jet fragmentation, jet flavor composition, etc., neatly described in~\cite{bib:CMS:JME_PAS}.
The correction is applied as a multiplicand on each jet's transverse momentum contained in an event.
The corresponding systematic uncertainty is accessed by a up and down variation of the correction factor within 1\,$\sigma$.
The resulting uncertainties are of minor importance and lie between $0.4-3.1\%$.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the jet energy resolution}
The jet energy resolution (JER) is smaller in simulation than in measured data (see Part~\ref{FIXME}). 
To take into account these differences, the jet energy response is additionally smeared to match the measured response.
The systematic uncertainties cover the uncertainty on the resolution in data, like the jet energy scale uncertainty, uncertainties arising from out-of-cone showering etc.~\cite{bib:CMS:JME_PAS,bib:Kristin_Thesis}.
The resulting uncertainty on the signal efficiency is between $0.1-2.0\%$ and therefore almost negligible.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of the parton distribution functions}
The parton distribution function (PDF) used for the simulation of proton-proton collisions is provided by the \cteq group~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} (see Section~\ref{FIXME} for more information about PDFs).
In~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw}, a detailed description of the methodology of the determination of a parton distribution function and its uncertainties is given.
Practically, the estimation of the PDF uncertainty is done by the application of 44 different sets of event weights which take into account 22 different sources of uncertainties~\cite{Botje:2011sn,bib:PDF_practical} 
(up and down variations lead to a factor of 2).
The sources correspond inter alia to uncertainties in the single distributions of gluons, up/down-quarks, etc, with the gluon distribution being by far the largest source of uncertainty.

The resulting uncertainties on the signal efficiency are between $2.6-6.8\%$.

\subsection*{Uncertainty of the pile-up reweighting}
As mentioned before, the distribution of the number of primary vertices is reweighted to match the measured distribution in data.
The number of interactions in data on the other hand is determined by the luminosity of each bunch-crossing times the proton-proton inelastic cross section which is 69.4\mb.
The uncertainty on the number of interactions consists thus out of the uncertainty on the luminosity and the uncertainty on the cross section.
To cover both sources, a variation of the inelastic cross section by plus/minus 5\% is done.

For most of the signal models and signal regions, the signal efficiency is only affected with less than 1\% by the pile-up reweighting uncertainty.
Due to limited statistical precision it can become larger in some signal regions, but those are never the most sensitive ones. 


\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of the calorimeter isolation}
The uncertainty on the simulation of the calorimeter isolation \ecalo is estimated by the comparison of the cut selection efficiency of $\ecalo<5\gev$ in the fake enriched control sample \fakeCR.
The fake enriched control region is well suited for this estimation, as fake tracks are also expected to deposit only a low amount of energy in the calorimeters.
The selection efficiency in data is higher than in simulation in both \pt bins of $30-50\gev$ and $50-\infty\gev$, which results in an uncertainty of 12.1\% and 3.0\% respectively.


\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of missing middle/inner hits}
The uncertainty on the simulation of the number of missing inner and middle hits is assessed by comparing the probability of passing the selection requirements of $N_{\text{miss}}^{\text{middle/inner}}=0$
of a candidate track in the muon-veto inverted control region. 
This control region is particularly suitable because muons are neither expected to have intrinsic sources of missing hits, as pions or electrons have.
Pions can interact nuclearly with the tracker material and electrons can have sizable radiative losses, such that both can change direction or don't deposit energy in a tracker layer.
For muons, on the other hand, sources of missing inner and middle hits are mainly algorithmic~\cite{bib:CMS:DT_Thesis,bib:CMS:DT_8TeV_AN}, 
making them very similar to the algorithmic sources of missing inner/middle hits for chargino tracks.

The uncertainty is estimated as the relative difference of the cut selection efficiency of $N_{\text{miss}}^{\text{middle/inner}}=0$ in data and simulation.
The selection efficiency is always higher in simulation, resulting in systematic uncertainties of around 3.5\% for the simulation of $N_{\text{miss}}^{\text{inner}}=0$ and around 2.2\% for $N_{\text{miss}}^{\text{middle}}=0$.
The uncertainties are of very similar size in the signal regions with different \pt.
No \ias dependence is considered.

\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of \ias}
An uncertainty on the simulation of \ias needs to be estimated to account for possible data-simulation differences for highly ionising particles.
The estimation of the \ias uncertainty is done as in~\cite{bib:CMS:HSCP_8TeV,bib:CMS:HSCP_8TeV_AN}.
The \ias uncertainty can be assessed by comparing data and simulation differences of slow protons.
Slow protons are highly ionising, thus, can be used to determine the uncertainty in the high \ias region.

%The estimation is done with the ``Minimum Bias'' samples also used for the pixel calibration (see Section~\ref{sec:EnergyCalibration}).
In order to select slow protons, good quality tracks with a momentum smaller than 2.5\gev are selected.
The \ias versus momentum distribution for the selected tracks are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IasVsMomentum}.
The kaon, proton and in data also the deuteron line is visible.
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \begin{tabular}{c}

  \caption{\ias versus momentum for good quality tracks with at least eight hits in observed data (left) and simulation (right).

  \label{fig:IasVsMomentum}
\end{figure} 
Two different slices in the momentum are extracted where the proton line is contained: p between $0.80-0.85$ and $0.95-1.00$.
A Gaussian function is fitted to the proton peak and the maximal difference of the mean the fitted Gaussian between simulation and observed data is taken as systematic uncertainty.
The \ias distribution for the two momentum ranges with the Gaussian fit is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:IasSlowProtons}.

           For the momentum range of $0.80-0.85\gev$, the proton line is contained between \ias values of $0.4-0.8$, whereas for the momentum range of $0.95-1.00\gev$, the proton line \ias lies between $0.2-0.6$.  }
  \label{fig:IasSlowProtons}
\end{figure} 
The systematic uncertainty is estimated to a value of 6\%.
The size of the systematic uncertainty is also expected to cover the data-simulation difference for minimal ionisation.


\subsection*{Uncertainty on the simulation of the track reconstruction efficiency}
One final source of uncertainty is the simulation of the track reconstruction efficiency.
Possible differences of the reconstruction efficiency in simulation and data can lead to a different signal acceptance.
Differences in the track reconstruction efficiency are especially expected for short tracks.
Therefore, a worst case estimation is done, comparing the track reconstruction efficiency in data and simulation for tracks with a number of hits of three.

In simulation and observed data, well reconstructed muon tracks are selected and all hits after the third hits are removed.
Afterwards the full track reconstruction step is again preformed.
The relative difference of the track reconstruction efficiency in data and simulation ($\epsilon = N_{\text{recon. track with \nhits=3}}/N_{\text{selected muon trks}}$) is taken as systematic uncertainty.
The track reconstruction efficiency is higher in simulation than in data and results in uncertainties between $4.6-6.0\%$.\\


\subsection*{Summary of systematic uncertainties of the simulated signal samples}
All systematic uncertainties are estimated for all simulated signal samples.
An overview of the range of the uncertainties is given in Table~\ref{tab:SignalSysUnc}.

In order to avoid an overestimation of the systematic uncertainties due to limited sizes of the samples (especially for low lifetimes like 1\cm), the corresponding signal sample with longer lifetime (100\cm) is used instead.
This is possible for uncertainty sources, for which the size is not affected by the lifetime of the chargino.
These are the uncertainties in ISR, trigger efficiency, JES, JER and PDF.

It can be seen, that major uncertainties are the simulation of the initial state radiation, of the calorimeter isolation, and of \ias.
The high maximal uncertainty of the pile-up uncertainty is caused by limited statistical precision.

The systematic uncertainties of the simulated signal samples are taken as fully correlated for the four signal bins into account.

\section{Statistical Methods/ Limit setting}
This section is a small interlude to give a short introduction into the methods and techniques of the exclusion of theoretical models used in this analysis.
For a detailed and pedagogical introduction to the methods, it is referred to~\cite{bib:Ott_Thesis}.

In this analysis the exclusion of the underlying theoretical model is achieved with the \CLs method~\cite{bib:CLS_1999,bib:CLS_2000,bib:CLS_2002}.
The \CLs method was developed for the Higgs searches at LEP in order not to overestimate the exclusion power of a result when an  under-fluctuation of the Standard Model expectation occurs.
\CLs is defined as the confidence level for the background plus signal hypothesis divided by the confidence level for the background hypothesis only
\begin{equation*}
\CLs = \frac{\CLsb}{\CLb}.
\end{equation*}
The confidence level CL is defined as the probability to observe less than or equal the number of observed events P($n<n_{\text{obs}}$) for a given background (or background+signal) hypothesis.
In general, the considered distribution can be any constructed test statistics $Q$ and is not necessarily the distribution in the number of events.
However, For Poissonian statistics it leads to the following expressions for \CLsb and \CLb for one signal region
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\CLsb &= \text{Poisson}\left( n<n_{\text{obs}} |\lambda = b+\mu\cdot s   \right),\\
\CLb  &= \text{Poisson}\left( n<n_{\text{obs}} |\lambda = b   \right),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\lambda$ is the mean of the Poisson distribution and $\mu$ is the signal strength.
The signal strength $\mu$ is a measure for the size of the signal cross section.

In order to include systematic uncertainties, the background expectation $b$ or the signal expectation $\mu\cdot s$ are varied within a Gaussian distribution with a width estimated as the 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty and a mean of zero.
For one source of systematic uncertainty on the background, this leads to the following expressions for \CLsb and \CLb
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\CLsb &= \text{Poisson}\left( n<n_{\text{obs}} |\lambda = b \cdot (1+\delta_b)+\mu\cdot s   \right) \text{Gauss}\left(\delta_b|\text{mean}=0, \sigma = \delta_b\right),\\
\CLb  &= \text{Poisson}\left( n<n_{\text{obs}} |\lambda = b \cdot (1+\delta_b)   \right) \text{Gauss}\left(\delta_b|\text{mean}=0, \sigma = \delta_b\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
These expressions can be generalised for more than one signal region and more than one systematic uncertainty~\cite{bib:Ott_Thesis}.
A model is considered as excluded at a 95\% confidence level when \CLs is smaller than 5\%.



In this search, the systematic uncertainties on the background expectation are taken as (un-)correlated according to Table~\ref{tab:BkgSysUncCorr}.
The systematic uncertainties on the expected signal yields are considered fully correlated.

\section{Exclusion limits}

The search for highly ionising short tracks is interpreted in the context of SUSY models with almost mass degenerate wino-like charginos and neutralinos.
As explained in the previous section, the exclusion is done with the help of the \CLs method.
Two direct production channels are taken into account: chargino pair production and chargino neutralino production. 
The corresponding cross sections can be found in Table~\ref{tab:SignalCrossSections}.
The exclusion limits are derived with the \textit{Combine} framework~\cite{bib:CMS:Combine} that was developed for the Higgs searches at CMS.
The systematic uncertainties on the background and the signal yields  are modelled with log-normal distributions, whereas the statistical uncertainties on the background are modelled with gamma distributions.
A log-normal distribution is used instead of a normal distribution to ensure that the prediction cannot become negative.
The gamma distribution is well suited for statistical uncertainties arising from limited statistical precision in control regions or in simulated samples that are use for the background estimation.

In total, 37 different lifetimes for every mass point are considered, leading to 37 different exclusion limits.
Four exemplary exclusion limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1dLimits}, the full set of exclusion limits can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:ExlusionLimits}.

           The black line is the observed limit.
           The signal cross section is depicted as dark green line. 
           SUSY models can be excluded with a 95\% confidence when the signal cross section is large as the 95\% observed upper limit on the cross section.}
  \label{fig:1dLimits}
\end{figure} 
The upper 95\%\,CL limit on the cross section is strongest for intermediate lifetimes ($10-100\cm$).
For lower lifetimes a sizable fraction of the charginos decay already before they reach the tracking system, thus aren't visible in the tracker.
For longer lifetimes, the cross section upper limit becomes again weaker because the charginos start to be reconstructed as muons (the muon veto thus rejects these events).
Also the \ecalo requirement rejects these charginos with higher efficiency.

Due to the falling spectrum of the chargino production cross section, charginos with lower masses are more effectively excluded than charginos with a higher mass.
A 2-dimensional exclusion limit in the chargino lifetime-mass parameter space is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2dLimit}.

Charginos with a masses of 100\gev can be excluded down to a lifetime of $~2\cm$.
Charginos with a higher mass of 500\gev are excluded for lifetimes between $60-700\cm$.

Since the long lifetime of the chargino is caused by the small mass splitting between $m_{\chipm}$ and $m_{\chi0}$, 
it is possible to express the lifetime of the chargino also as a mass gap $\Delta m_{\chipm\chiO}$ between the chargino and the lightest neutralino~\cite{bib:MassSplitting_Drees}.
The corresponding 2d exclusion limit can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaMLimit2d}.

           Everything below the red line is excluded up to the region where the mass splitting is smaller than the pion mass.}

This search is sensitive to mass splittings between $\sim 140\mev-210\mev$.

The derived exclusion limits of this search could confirm the exclusion from~\cite{FIXME} with small improvements in the medium mass range up to FIXME\gev.
A comparison of the two searches is shown in Fig.~\ref{FIXME}.
