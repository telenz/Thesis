\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\vspace{1cm}

I would like to thank all people that supported me in many very different ways during my PhD.
I want to thank Christian Sander and Peter Schleper who agreed on reviewing my dissertation.
I also owe thanks to the other members of the disputation committee, Isabell Melzer-Pellmann, Jan Louis, and Dieter Horns.
They made a very uncomplicated planning of my disputation possible.
And finally, I want to thank Johannes Haller who stepped in spontaneously as a referee for my disputation.\\

This work has only been possible due to the continuous and invaluable support by Christian Sander, Lukas Vanelderen, Hartmut Stadie, Lo\"{i}c Quertenmont, Wells Wulsin, and Francesco Pandolfi.
The always interesting and helpful exchanges and discussions with them facilitated my work and were of great pleasure during the last years.

I would like to thank all of my colleagues in Hamburg who created a very nice and relaxed atmosphere. 
My special thanks go to Mareike Meyer, Kristin Goebel, and Rebekka H\"{o}ing, my colleagues with whom I shared the office most of the time during the last years. 
Thank you for the support during and outside of work.\\

Finally, I would like to say thank you to all who are not involved into physics and helped me particularly in not losing my psychological and physical stability: my friends, my family, and especially Markus.
