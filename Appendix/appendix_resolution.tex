\section{Generator-level jet flavor definition}
\label{res:app:FlavorDefinition}

The algorithmic flavor definition uses the following discrimination:

\begin{itemize}
\item Try to find the parton that most likely determines the properties of the jet and assign that flavor as true flavor
\item Here, the ``final state'' partons (after showering, radiation) are analyzed (also within $\Delta$R $<$ 0.3 of reconstructed jet cone)
\item Jets from radiation are matched with full efficiency
\item If there is a b/c within the jet cone: label as b/c
\item Otherwise: assign flavor of the hardest parton 
\end{itemize}
